Learn about RESTful APIs and JSON.Build Tools and Task Runners:Explore tools like Webpack, Gulp, or Parcel to automate tasks, bundle and optimize your code. Testing and Debugging: Learn about testing frameworks and debugging tools to ensure your code is robust and bug-free. Web Security: Understand common security issues and best practices for securing your web applications. Continuous Learning: Stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in web development. Follow blogs, attend webinars, and participate in the developer community. Portfolio: Build a portfolio showcasing your projects. This is essential for demonstrating your skills to potential employers or clients. Collaboration and Version Control Hosting: Get familiar with platforms like GitHub or GitLab for hosting your code repositories and collaborating with others. Deployment: Learn how to deploy your web applications to servers or cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Netlify Soft Skills: Develop soft skills like problem-solving, communication, and teamwork. These are crucial in a collaborative development environment. Remember, practice is key in web development.
