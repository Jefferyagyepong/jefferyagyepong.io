        It seems like every other day there's a new design trend to learn, tool<br/>
        to master, and endless design-related articles to read. Honestly, it can<br/>
        be overwhelming and intimidating. I know because I've walked more than a<br/>
        few miles in those shoes. So whether you're new to the field or simply<br/>
        looking for some guidance and support, I can help.
